# Introduction
This code is an python based code for spam email classification. The original emails are .txt files with html tags. Necessary data cleaning and feature extraction is done in `Testfile.ipynb` and the training is done in the `Spam_Email_classification.ipynb`.

Since emails come from different sources might have different patterns, therefore a customized data cleaning process is recommended before the implementation of the classification.

## Library dependencies for the python code.
Need to import Functions.py in order to run the code.
