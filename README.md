# Introduction
This code is an python based code for spam email classification. The original emails are .txt files with html tags. Necessary data cleaning and word stemming is done by the functions in `Function.py` and the training is done in the `Spam_Email_classification.ipynb`.

Since emails come from different sources might have different patterns, therefore a customized data cleaning process is recommended before the implementation of the classification.

## Library dependencies for the python code.
Need to import Functions.py in order to run the code.
nltk need to be installed since it is used to stem words using PorterStemmer
